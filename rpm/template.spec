%description
Filter which fuses angular velocities, accelerations, and (optionally) magnetic
readings from a generic IMU device into a quaternion to represent the
orientation of the device wrt the global frame. Based on the algorithm by
Roberto G. Valenti etal. described in the paper &quot;Keeping a Good Attitude: A
Quaternion-Based Orientation Filter for IMUs and MARGs&quot; available at
http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/8/19302 .
